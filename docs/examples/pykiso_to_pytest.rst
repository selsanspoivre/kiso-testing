Pykiso to Pytest
================

If you want to use as testing framework pytest while using the test-setup
generator of pykiso (YAML-based generation of auxiliaries and communication
channels), you can use the pykiso_to_pytest command to convert existing pykiso
yaml configuration into a pytest fixture.


.. code:: bash

    pykitest examples/dummy.yaml


Example can be found inside examples/pytest.
